# Real-Time Weather Information & Data Logger

This project is a Python-based application that fetches **live weather information** using the OpenWeatherMap API, displays weather details for a user-specified city, and logs the data into a CSV file with timestamps.  
The program follows an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** structure and includes **error handling** to ensure smooth operation.
